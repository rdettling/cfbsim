## Introduction

Initially started as a school project, CFBSim.net evolved into a way for me to get better at Django and databases.

## Usage

1. Visit [CFBSim.net](https://cfbsim.net).
2. Select a year to begin the simulation. A schedule will automatically be generated.
3. Choose a team to 'control.' This selection mainly affects the dashboard display and doesn't influence the simulation's outcome.
